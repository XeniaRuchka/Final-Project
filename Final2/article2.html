        <p>Cinephiles, culture vultures, and curiosity seekers take heart, Vidiots' "VHS Vault" screening series monthly presents films from our rare collection for your viewing pleasure. Screenings are followed by an extended conversations with filmmakers, programmers, critics and experts.

A combination of socially-conscious, entertaining and educational films speak to the eclectic nature of Los Angeles and cater to the city's diverse interests, cultures, and generations. This monthly screening series was made possible by a grant from the City of Santa Monica Cultural Affairs Division.</p>
                <p>
                        CHRONOPOLIS, Piotr Kamler's 1983, French, animated Sci-fi epic tells the story of an enormous city, lurking in the sky and colonized by immortals jaded with eternal life. Kamler's first and only full-length film, Variety hailed CHRONOPOLIS as a "stunning trip to the Twilight Zone in magic hands" of Kamler.

                <p>
                        Audio-visualists Strangeloop (David Wexler) and Laskfar Vortok (Gavin Gamboa) join Vidiots to re-score Kamler's visionary work. Wexler, who founded the Teaching Machine audio-visual collective with Gamboa, worked at Vidiots over a decade ago, which fed his insatiable appetite for experimental cinema and helped him assemble the lexicon of imagery that would be instrumental to his video art.</p>
                <p>
                        Wexler would eventually found Strangeloop Studios, a company focused on producing visual shows for artists like Flying Lotus, Erykah Badu, and The Weeknd. In exploring the depth of the seemingly infinite Vidiots archive of obscure films and animation, Wexler discovered CHRONOPOLIS on VHS in 2005, which at the time seemed like an elusive work of media, unavailable in practically any other format. While not being a well-known film, CHRONOPOLIS is a completely unique work of genius science fiction, imaginatively executed stop-animation weds with a symbolically dense narrative about time, higher intelligence, and the nature of reality. Gamboa, while creating visual shows with Wexler at his company Strangeloop Studios, is also a performer of classical music and an experimental composer whose works have received several international premieres. Inspired by the groundbreaking work of Pierre Schaeffer, whose music is featured in the original score, Gamboa and Wexler will utilize a combination of electronic and acoustic sounds to re-imagine the sonic landscape of CHRONOPOLIS and bring the work to a contemporary audience.
